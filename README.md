# Magic Mirror Module for displaying the next UVX bus in the Provo/Orem, UT area!

Made a couple arrays of the UVX schedule for weekdays and saturdays, and used a couple checks to determine the next arrival for the 2230 North station in Provo. 

Currently doesn't account for holiday schedules, because the UTA API is a nightmare to figure out for me, so I just added a static warning to check holiday times.
